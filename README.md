# SVG Logo Maker

A command-line application that generates SVG logos based on user input.

## Description

The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js application that allows users to create simple logos by providing text, colors, and shapes. The application generates an SVG file representing the logo and saves it for further use.

The application prompts the user for input, including the text for the logo, text color, shape choice, and shape color. It supports three shape options: triangle, circle, and square. The user can enter color keywords or hexadecimal color codes to customize the logo's appearance.
